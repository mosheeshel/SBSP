### Scientific Paper: Harvesting Solar/Space Radiation via Space-Based Satellites for Global Energy Needs

#### Abstract
This paper explores the feasibility and potential of a space-based system to harvest electromagnetic (EM) radiation and convert it into electricity to meet global energy demands. By positioning satellites equipped with advanced rectennas and thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells in geosynchronous orbit, this system aims to capture solar energy efficiently and transmit it to Earth. Our calculations indicate that even with substantial efficiency losses, such a system can contribute significantly to global energy needs.

#### Introduction
The increasing demand for clean and renewable energy sources has driven research into space-based solar power (SBSP). Traditional photovoltaic (PV) systems, while effective, face challenges such as atmospheric interference and diurnal cycles. This paper proposes an alternative approach: harvesting EM radiation, including microwaves and infrared, using satellites equipped with rectennas and TPV cells. This method aims to simplify the space-based components and improve energy transmission efficiency.

#### System Design
##### Satellite Configuration
- **Harvesting Arrays**: Satellites are equipped with rectennas for microwave energy and TPV cells for infrared radiation. Positioned in geosynchronous orbit, these satellites have a larger effective collection area than ground-based systems.
- **Energy Conversion**: The collected EM radiation is converted into direct current (DC) electricity. Energy is shared among satellites to balance supply, minimizing the need for onboard storage.
- **Transmission to Earth**: High-gain directional antennas beam microwaves to ground receivers, while wide-beam antennas broadcast RF energy for wireless charging of IoT devices and sensors.

#### Efficiency Calculations
##### Solar Energy Incident
- **Irradiance**: \(1361 \, \text{W/m}^2\)
- **Cross-sectional Area of Earth**: \(1.275 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2\)
- **Total Solar Power Incident**: \(1.735 \times 10^{17} \, \text{W}\)

##### Collection Area and Efficiency
- **Geosynchronous Orbit Surface Area**: \(2.234 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2\)
- **Collected Area (0.1%)**: \(2.234 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2\)
- **Power Collected**: \(3.04 \times 10^{16} \, \text{W}\)
- **Power Delivered (95% Loss)**: \(1.52 \, \text{TW}\)

##### Comparison with Global Energy Needs
- **Global Power Consumption**: \(19.8 \, \text{TW}\)
- **Contribution**: \(1.52 \, \text{TW}\) (~7.7% of global needs)

#### Experimental Suggestions
1. **Prototype Rectenna Arrays**: Develop and test rectenna arrays in a controlled environment to optimize energy conversion efficiency.
2. **TPV Cell Optimization**: Research advanced materials for TPV cells to enhance their ability to capture a broader spectrum of infrared radiation.
3. **Small-Scale Satellite Tests**: Launch small-scale satellites equipped with these technologies to evaluate performance in space and test energy transmission to Earth.
4. **Ground Receiver Development**: Create and test ground-based receivers to efficiently convert transmitted microwaves and RF energy into usable electricity.

#### Applications
- **Global Energy Supply**: Provide a significant contribution to the world's energy needs, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
- **Remote Power Solutions**: Supply power to remote and off-grid locations using RF energy broadcast from space.
- **IoT and Sensor Networks**: Enable widespread deployment of IoT devices and sensors powered by wireless energy transmission.

#### Conclusion
This paper demonstrates the potential of a space-based system to harvest EM radiation for electricity generation. By leveraging advanced technologies and optimizing efficiency, such a system can significantly contribute to global energy needs. Further research and experimentation are required to overcome technical challenges and fully realize this vision.
