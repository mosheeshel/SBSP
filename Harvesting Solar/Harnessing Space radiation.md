# Manifesto: Harnessing Space radiation for a Sustainable Future

#### Introduction
In an era where the demand for clean, renewable energy is paramount, we present a revolutionary concept: harvesting electromagnetic (EM) radiation from space to power our planet. By deploying satellites equipped with advanced energy conversion technologies in geosynchronous orbit, we can tap into the virtually limitless energy of the Sun and other EM sources. This manifesto outlines the vision, feasibility, and benefits of this groundbreaking approach.

#### The Vision
Imagine a world where energy is abundant, clean, and accessible to all. By harnessing EM radiation from space, we can create a global energy system that transcends the limitations of traditional power sources. Our satellites will continuously collect and convert solar energy, beaming it down to Earth to power homes, industries, and innovative technologies.

#### The Science
##### Efficient Energy Harvesting
- **Rectennas**: Convert microwave radiation into direct current (DC) electricity with high efficiency.
- **TPV Cells**: Capture infrared radiation and convert it into electricity using advanced semiconductor materials.

##### Optimized Transmission
- **High-Gain Antennas**: Beam energy directly to ground-based receivers with minimal loss.
- **Wide-Beam Antennas**: Broadcast RF energy across large areas for wireless power applications.

#### Feasibility and Impact
##### Calculations and Potential
- **Solar Power Incident on Earth**: \(1.735 \times 10^{17} \, \text{W}\)
- **Collected Power**: \(3.04 \times 10^{16} \, \text{W}\) with 0.1% collection area in space.
- **Delivered Power**: \(1.52 \, \text{TW}\) with 95% efficiency loss, covering 7.7% of global energy needs.

##### Applications
- **Global Energy Supply**: Transform the energy landscape by providing a substantial portion of the world's electricity needs.
- **Remote Power**: Deliver power to remote and underserved areas, fostering development and connectivity.
- **IoT and Smart Devices**: Enable a new generation of wireless, self-powered devices and sensors, revolutionizing industries from agriculture to healthcare.

#### Call to Action
To bring this vision to life, we call on governments, research institutions, and the private sector to invest in the development and deployment of space-based EM energy harvesting technologies. By collaborating on research, funding pilot projects, and creating supportive regulatory frameworks, we can turn this bold idea into reality.

#### Conclusion
Harnessing space-based electromagnetic energy offers a path to a sustainable, energy-abundant future. By embracing this innovative approach, we can address global energy challenges, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and pave the way for a cleaner, greener world. Join us in making this vision a reality.
