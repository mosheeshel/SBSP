### Manifesto: Harnessing Space-Based Energy for a Sustainable Future

#### Introduction
In an era where the demand for clean, renewable energy is paramount, we present a revolutionary concept: harvesting energy from space to power our planet. By deploying a collection array equipped with advanced energy conversion technologies at one of the Lagrange Points (L1, L4, or L5), complemented by Solar Power Satellites (SPS) in geosynchronous orbit, we can tap into the virtually limitless energy of the Sun. This manifesto outlines the vision, feasibility, and benefits of this groundbreaking approach.

#### The Vision
Imagine a world where energy is abundant, clean, and accessible to all. By harnessing energy from space, we can create a global energy system that transcends the limitations of traditional power sources. Our collection array will continuously collect and convert solar energy, with SPS distributing it to Earth to power homes, industries, and innovative technologies.

#### The Science
**Efficient Energy Harvesting**
- **Collector Arrays at Lagrange Points**: The primary energy harvesting will be performed by collector arrays deployed at one of the Lagrange Points (L1, L4, or L5). These arrays will continuously beam the collected energy to the closest SPS. There are several different energy harvesting methods:
  - **Photovoltaic (PV) Cells**: Convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials. PV cells are a well-established technology with continually improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
  - **Rectennas**: Convert microwave radiation into direct current (DC) electricity with high efficiency.
  - **TPV Cells**: Capture infrared radiation and convert it into electricity using advanced semiconductor materials.
  - **Other Radiation Harvesting Methods**: Explore and develop technologies to harvest other forms of electromagnetic radiation, ensuring a comprehensive approach to energy capture.

**Optimized Transmission**
- **Solar Power Satellites (SPS)**: Positioned in geosynchronous orbit to relay energy collected from the Lagrange point arrays using mirrors or other low-loss transmission methods, ensuring minimal energy loss. SPS are equipped with high-gain and wide-beam antennas to transmit power to Earth.
- **Continuous Power Collection and Beaming**: The system ensures continuous power collection and beaming, eliminating the need for batteries in the space part of this architecture. Satellites on the dark side of the planet will receive energy through transmission from another satellite that has line-of-sight (LOS) to the energy source or another transmitting satellite.
- **High-Gain Antennas**: Part of the SPS, these antennas beam energy directly to ground-based receivers with minimal loss.
- **Wide-Beam Antennas**: Also part of the SPS, these antennas broadcast RF energy across large areas for wireless power applications.

**Planet-Bound Components**
- **Rectennas**: Ground-based rectennas will capture the microwave energy beamed down from the SPS. These rectennas convert the microwave energy back into DC electricity for use in the power grid.
- **Base Stations**: Ground-based base stations equipped with receivers for both high-gain and wide-beam antennas will harness the energy transmitted from space. These stations will distribute the energy into the existing power grid and support wireless power applications for IoT devices and other smart technologies.

#### Feasibility and Impact
This is a long-term project that could extend over an unknown number of decades or even centuries. The vision of covering a significant area in space with energy harvesting collectors is currently beyond human capability and would require the development of self-replicating machines or other advanced automated systems. However, the fundamental principles behind the idea are sound, and many of the necessary technologies already exist in some form.

**Calculations and Potential**
To provide a sense of scale, if we were able to deploy collectors covering 0.01% of the surface area at a Lagrange point, we could collect approximately \(3.04 \times 10^{15} \, \text{W}\) of power. With a 50% efficiency loss, this would result in \(1.52 \, \text{TW}\) of delivered power, which covers about 7.7% of global energy needs. While this level of deployment is far in the future, it highlights the enormous potential of space-based energy harvesting.

**Applications**
- **Global Energy Supply**: Transform the energy landscape by providing a substantial portion of the world's electricity needs.
- **Remote Power**: Deliver power to remote and underserved areas, fostering development and connectivity.
- **IoT and Smart Devices**: Enable a new generation of wireless, self-powered devices and sensors, revolutionizing industries from agriculture to healthcare.
- **Generic Power Supply Solution**: Applicable to any star-orbiting body, with efficiency depending on the star's output and the distance of the stellar object from the star.

#### Call to Action
To bring this vision to life, we call on governments, research institutions, and the private sector to invest in the development and deployment of space-based energy harvesting technologies. Initial steps should focus on smaller-scale prototypes and incremental advancements. By collaborating on research, funding pilot projects, and creating supportive regulatory frameworks, we can lay the groundwork for this ambitious endeavor.

#### Conclusion
Harnessing space-based energy offers a path to a sustainable, energy-abundant future. While the full realization of this vision may take decades or even centuries, the foundation can be built today. By embracing this innovative approach, we can address global energy challenges, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and pave the way for a cleaner, greener world. Join us in making this vision a reality.
